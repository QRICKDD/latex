The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We first briefly review the related work in Section \ref{sec:related-work} and formulate the problem mathematically in Section \ref{sec:problem-formulation}. Then, the proposed Sliding Attack is presented in Section \ref{sec:method}. Section \ref{sec:Experiments} provide the quantitative and qualitative experimental results. Finally, Section \ref{sec:Conclusion} concludes this work.
