Compare gradient aggregation in different situations. Gradients obtained from samples without preprocessing are usually similar, and the aggregated gradients are oriented toward the. However, when attacking an ensemble model composed of models of different lengths, it needs to clip or self-splice the sample and input them into the corresponding model. Both the samples and the model are quite different, so gradients may be dissimilar and the aggregated gradient is likely to be away from.
