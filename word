We denote genuine synthetic speech detection input sample as , and its associated ground-truth label is. The corresponding adversarial example as , the synthetic speech detection model with input length as , where and. The model parameters of is denoted by and is used to indicate the loss for. To generate an effective adversarial example, one shall maximize the loss for the input sample.The adversarial example generation can be formulated as the following optimization framework:
